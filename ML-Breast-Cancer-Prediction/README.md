# ML-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Its an Machine Learning Model for Breast Cancer Prediction.
<br/><br/>
Created a Machine Learning Model to predict the Breast Cancer by analyzing the factors and variables given in the Dataset.
I also compare 4 Machine Learning models predictions by creating a dataframe and entering the accuracy score and the respective machine learning model.

Plot I: This is the Countplot defining the counts of Malignant cancer and Benign cancer.

Plot II: This is the Heatmap defining the correlations between different variables/factors given in the Dataset.

***Libraries Used for creating model:***
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
---
***Accuracy results given by different Machine Learning Algorithms:***
1. **Logistic Regression** = 0.982456
2. **Decision Tree Classifier** =	0.923977
3. **Random Forest Classifier** = 0.959064
4. **Support Vector Classifier** = 0.964912

<br/>
At the end I concluded that for our predictions the accuracy score of **98.2456%** is achieved
And Logistic Regression works best for this particular Machine Learning Model.
<br/>
After Studying hard for 2 days and completing and submitting my model, I finally got my **certificate** for this model training:<br/><br/>
